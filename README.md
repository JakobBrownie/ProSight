# ProSight

- Prosight is an internal application that I worked on while at interning for The Normandy Group. Due to this project being internal I can not share the code but can describe some of the things I worked on!

- Prosight web: Angular
    - Developed bug fixes and feature implementations on their web version of prosight using javascript and a SQL database.
    - Implmented things like email notifications when an expense report is submitted or approved/ denied. Email based on User's role, submitting sends to managment, approval/ denial sends to user that submitted the report.
    - Bug fixes that required SQL changes such as a user filter defaulting to unassigned rather than to the current user

- Prosight mobile: Flutter
